# Forecasting Model of Federal Fund Rates

## Overview

This project applies a SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) model to forecast the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) over the next 24 months.

## Importance of the Federal Funds Rate

The Federal Funds Rate (FFR) is a key economic indicator of U.S. monetary policy, influencing economic growth and unemployment rates. The Federal Reserve sets the FFR based on factors such as inflation and the equilibrium interest rate. Changes in the FFR affect borrowing costs for banks, influencing interest rates on loans, credit cards, and bank deposits.

A lower FFR makes it easier for banks to borrow funds and maintain the required 10% reserve ratio, facilitating increased lending to businesses and individuals. This, in turn, can stimulate economic growth by encouraging investment and spending. Conversely, raising the FFR helps control inflation by making borrowing more expensive, which can slow down economic activity.
